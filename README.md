# Stock Price Streaming with gRPC

This project demonstrates a real-time stock price streaming service using gRPC.  It provides a client and server implementation for subscribing to and receiving live stock price updates.


## Introduction

This project showcases how to build a high-performance, real-time data streaming application using gRPC.  It's designed to provide a foundation for building financial data services or any application requiring live updates.  The example focuses on streaming stock prices, but the principles can be applied to other data streams.

## Features

* **Real-time Stock Price Streaming:**  Subscribes to a stream of stock price updates.
* **gRPC-based Communication:** Leverages gRPC for efficient and robust communication between client and server.
* **Protocol Buffer Definitions:** Uses Protocol Buffers for defining the service interface and data structures.
* **Example Client and Server:** Provides ready-to-run client and server implementations.
* **Clear and Concise Code:**  Easy to understand and modify.
